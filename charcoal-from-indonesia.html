                <p> <a href="http://rumahsabut.com/">Charcoal from Indonesia</a> - Indonesia country's natural wealth is actually very rich, especially the product of coconut commodity which is the main raw material of coconut shell charcoal briquettes. Did you know? Indonesia country is the first in coconut productivity in the Asian region?</p>
                    
                <p> Based on research, briquettes made from coconut shell charcoal have many advantages over briquettes made from charcoal or other fuels. See the following description.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Renewable energy</li>
                            <p>So what I mean by renewable energy is energy that we can get and come from natural sources, now this
                                raw material is the result of a stable natural process. It will never run out because it is always
                                produced by nature as long as we continue to preserve it.</p>
                        <li>Biomass</li>
                                <p>Coconut charcoal briquettes are included in the energy of biomass category. Biomass is a type of
                                    renewable energy that refers to biological material derived from 100% natural material. Some
                                    examples of biophysical sources include firewood, coconut, garbage, and fossil-energy.</p>
                        <li>Maximum heat generated</li>
                                <p>In contrast to charcoal briquettes, it turns out that the level of heat produced by coconut shell
                                    charcoal briquettes is quite high at 7000 cal. Therefore, high-calorie ingredients allow our cooking
                                    process to cook faster and more perfectly.</p>
                        <li>Not toxic</li>
                                <p>Now, the process of making coconut charcoal briquettes is naturally and eco-friendly, the product of
                                    briquettes are safe for us. The only additive material is a kind of tapioca starch obtained from cassava as a briquette dough
                                    adhesive. It makes coconut charcoal briquettes a safe and non-toxic material.</p>
                        <li>no smoke</li>
                                <p>If you burn charcoal it will usually emit a lot of smoke, for example, you can see when you make a
                                    chicken barbeque with wood charcoal a lot of smoke will come out, even if the chicken barbeque
                                    smells fragrant. vBut it is a different thing if you use this coconut charcoal briquette. When it burns, very little
                                    smoke is produced, almost not smoky, so it does not disturb your neighbor.</p>
                        <li>Switch to green energy</li>
                                <p>The most famous benefits of using coconut shell charcoal briquettes. Go Green Energy is the term for
                                    an environmentally friendly energy source.</p>
                
                                <p>Yes, as I said earlier, with the advantages of coconut charcoal briquettes made from raw coconut and
                                    cassava flour additives, if baked smoke-free, then these coconut shell charcoal briquettes are very
                                    environmentally friendly.</p>
                        <li>Charcoal substitute</li>
                                <p>If we look at it often, the fuel used mainly for the industry is coal. But from time to time, based
                                        on some studies, it turns out that the discovery of coal on a large scale will be very dangerous to
                                        nature.</p>
                    
                                <p>In addition, it turns out that charcoal, more likely and classified as toxic, is inhaled by humans.
                                        This is why coconut shell charcoal briquettes can be an alternative fuel solution for charcoal.</p>
                        <li>Long burning time</li>
                                <p>Coconut Charcoal Briquettes have a long burning time, about 2-3 hours non-stop. This makes it a
                                        relatively efficient and effective fuel.</p>
                        <li>As an alternative to the use of gas stoves</li>
                                <p>Almost all of us use gas stoves for cooking, right? Moreover, now that gas prices continue to rise
                                        and sometimes consumption is still low, we are disappointed.</p>
                    </ul>
                <p>Therefore, in line with the development of technology and the times, some manufacturers of coconut
                    shell <a href="https://rumahsabut.com/briquette-manufacturers/">charcoal from Indonesia</a>  have seen their potential in making briquette stoves. The objective is to
                    replace the gas stoves used by households so far.</p>
